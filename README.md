Welcome to Block Puzzle Equipment Game!

The gems on the right side of the screen represent equipment, spells, skills, and other useful abilities. The goal of the game is to put gems together to make a useful combination of combat abilities. The exact workings of the abilities are intentionally vague, because there's no actual combat. They should be understandable enough.

CONTROLS

Clicking a gem on the right will cause it to appear in the grid. Clicking it again will remove it from the grid.
When a gem is in the grid, you can click and drag it around. While holding a gem this way, pressing any key will rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. Pressing the 'a' key will rotate it counter-clockwise instead.
Whenever you hover your mouse over a gem, its name and description will appear in a box at the bottom of the screen.
Click the "Next" button at the bottom-right to scroll the list of gems down. Pressing the 's' key will also scroll it down, and pressing the 'w' key will scroll it up.

RULES

Some gems are equipment, indicated by having an equipment type in its description: "Weapon", "Sidearm", "Armor", or "Accessory". You can only equip up to one of each equipment type; you can't wield two weapons, and you can't wear two sets of armor.
Gems aren't allowed to overlap. When two gems overlap, a yellow caution icon will appear to let you know where the overlap is.

Once you've finished putting together your abilities, you can press the 'p' key to print out a list of all your gems for convenient copy-pasting. The print-out will appear in the console.
